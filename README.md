# pi-interactive-subagents — context-based RPC

Lightweight parallel subagents for Pi, without tmux. Each task runs in a background Pi RPC process with its own conversation. All tasks use the shared working directory unless an explicit `cwd` is supplied. The parent session displays progress, receives results and questions, and controls children.

This is the **4.0.0 breaking redesign** of the earlier tmux implementation. Target: `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` **0.84.2–0.85.x**, Node **22+**. It uses `agent_settled`, current extension tool APIs, and blocking RPC UI input. Older `@mariozechner` Pi versions are not supported.

## Model of operation

- One task → one child process → one persistent session.
- Each task requires `access: "read-only" | "full"`. Scope and coordination instructions belong in the task text, not an `ownership` field.
- Access filters tools; it is **not a filesystem sandbox or lock**. Shared ports, databases, build outputs and edits can still conflict. The parent validates the combined result.
- Children do not receive delegation tools. Only the parent launches subagents.
- Optional persistent JSON DAG workflows reuse the same children. No worktrees, auto-merge, automatic retries, loops, condition-expression language, alternative CLI backends, or background daemon.

## Three context modes

Context controls information inheritance independently of tool access. There are no role definitions, profiles, or agent discovery:

| Mode | Inherited parent conversation |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | None. Task, access and cooperation guidance only (workflow steps also receive direct dependency results). |
| `partial` (default) | Explicit `contextText` selected/written by the parent. Required; use `none` for an independent task. |
| `full` | Frozen snapshot of the parent's active conversation branch at dispatch, respecting compaction summaries and retained messages. Includes the current assistant tool-calling message, not abandoned branches or later sibling results. |

`full` copies effective stored conversation messages, not the parent's system prompt, runtime extension state, provider payload rewrites or context-hook transformations. Tool and skill inheritance is the same in all three modes. Pending parent tool calls get explicit placeholder results in the child copy; no parent history is changed. None of the modes continuously synchronizes conversations.

## Runtime inheritance

Every new child receives a frozen snapshot of the parent's **active nondelegation tools**, restricted by access, and **all loaded skills**, plus the reserved blocking `ask_question` bridge. No profile or ambient-config tool/skill discovery is used:

- `full` preserves the parent's active nondelegation tool capabilities; it does not grant extra OS permissions.
- `read-only` keeps only verified builtin `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` tools already active in the parent, plus `ask_question`. It excludes bash, edits, writes, all extension tools and builtin overrides, and does not load inherited tool-provider extensions. Explicit provider-only entrypoints are loaded separately and do not grant tool access. This is tool filtering, not OS isolation; builtins, skills and host configuration must still be trusted.

- Tool names, JSON schemas, descriptions, guidelines and canonical source paths come from Pi's live `getActiveTools()` / `getAllTools()` APIs at launch. Inactive tools are not granted; an empty parent tool set grants only `ask_question`.
- Skills come from the actual `before_agent_start.systemPromptOptions.skills` inventory, including package/CLI/extension-contributed skills and `disable-model-invocation` skills. Hidden skills retain their explicit-only behavior. Children load those exact skill files with `--skill`, not a fresh directory scan.
- Builtins are reconstructed by Pi. File-backed extension tools (including builtin overrides and tools registered at startup) reload from their canonical runtime provider files. Child preflight compares each tool's schema/metadata and canonical builtin/extension provenance, plus the complete skill inventory/metadata, **before sending the task to a model**. Builtin substitution, missing tools/skills, changed metadata and extra contributed skills fail explicitly. Tool-call guards also check for later tool replacement.
- The model defaults to the parent's current `provider/model` ID and thinking level. `model` explicitly overrides that ID; thinking is clamped by Pi to the selected model. The selected model must be available in the child; it never silently falls back to another model.

**Reconstruction boundary:** Pi exposes tool metadata, not executable closures. Extension memory, interactive setup, runtime flags, parent-only hooks, in-memory authentication/provider registrations and SDK tool implementations are not copied. SDK/inline tools, virtual/missing skill files, providers that fail to reload, and dynamically configured tools that cannot recreate matching definitions are refused rather than silently dropped. File-backed providers must support fresh RPC startup; they may fail if they require interactive setup or other extensions not backing an inherited active tool. Provider extensions may opt in via the synchronous `rpc-subagents:provider-source:v1` event (`{ provider, register(absoluteEntrypointPath) }`). Advertised provider-only entrypoints are frozen in the loadout, revalidated on launch/continuation, and retained under read-only access. They must be trusted and must not restore another model, enable tools or install account-failover/session hooks. Unadvertised provider-only extensions are not inherited. `pi-multi-account` supplies a dedicated Antigravity entrypoint for this contract; it registers only the requested account, without rotation or model restore. Authentication comes from environment/config, not parent-only in-memory credentials.

Automatic extension, skill, prompt-template and context-file (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) discovery is disabled in children. Required project instructions belong in task/context. Pi's normal system-prompt configuration may still apply, with child cooperation guidance appended; the parent system prompt is not copied. Files backing skills/extensions are not content-pinned: continuation revalidates inventories and metadata, but implementation/body changes with unchanged metadata can change behavior.

**No nested delegation:** this package's creation/management tools, legacy `subagent*` tools and conventional `spawn_agent`/`manage_agents`/`delegate_task` names are excluded. The CLI allowlist prevents providers from enabling extra tools, and the child entrypoint never registers parent controls. Pi has no semantic capability tags: arbitrary custom aliases and general shell tools are not a security sandbox. Do not expose disguised delegation tools; children are instructed not to delegate or launch agent CLIs. All inherited extension code and skills must remain trusted.

## Tools

### Launch: `subagent`

```json
{
  "name": "auth",
  "task": "Fix expired-token handling and add tests",
  "access": "full",
  "context": "partial",
  "contextText": "The API returns 401 for expired tokens. Preserve the existing refresh contract."
}
```

Required: `task`, `access`. Optional: `name`, `model`, `cwd`, `context`, `contextText`. `contextText` is only accepted in `partial` mode. Names default to the context mode (`none`, `partial`, `full`); all names are deduplicated.

The call waits for startup/preflight and RPC acceptance, **not task completion**. Results and questions arrive automatically as parent messages. After launching, the parent can do independent work or end its turn. Do not poll to wait for completion.

For an independent review use `context: "none"`; for a continuation of a complex discussion use `context: "full"`. Tool and skill inheritance stays the same in every mode.

### Manage: `subagent_control`

```json
{ "action": "list" }
{ "action": "inspect", "id": "auth" }
{ "action": "history", "id": "auth", "limit": 20 }
{ "action": "message", "id": "auth", "message": "Also cover an empty refresh token" }
{ "action": "answer", "id": "auth", "questionId": "<ID from question>", "message": "Keep the existing API shape" }
{ "action": "cancel", "id": "auth" }
{ "action": "continue", "id": "auth", "message": "Address the review finding in the same module" }
```

`id` accepts the stable UUID or unique task name. `message` only targets a running task; use `continue` explicitly for a finished task. RPC acceptance means accepted/queued, not proven executed. When a question is pending, use `answer` with its ID instead of an ordinary message. Duplicate and stale answers are rejected.

`history` returns bounded tool calls/results from the retained session (default 20 entries, maximum 100). It is evidence of operations, **not an exact filesystem attribution audit**. Inspect actual diffs and verification too. A stopped standalone task can be continued with `access: "read-only"` to request explanations; new tasks retain their original access when omitted. Legacy records without `access` remain readable but require an explicit choice before continuation. Workflow steps use `workflow_control retry` rather than direct continuation.

### Workflows: `workflow_run` / `workflow_control`

```json
{
  "name": "auth-fix",
  "context": "partial",
  "contextText": "Fix expired-token handling without changing the refresh API.",
  "maxParallel": 3,
  "steps": [
    { "id": "investigate", "task": "Locate the bug and explain evidence", "access": "read-only", "dependsOn": [] },
    { "id": "fix", "task": "Implement the narrow fix and tests", "access": "full", "dependsOn": ["investigate"] },
    { "id": "validate", "task": "Run focused tests and report results", "access": "full", "dependsOn": ["fix"] },
    { "id": "review", "task": "Read the changes and validation report; identify remaining risks", "access": "read-only", "dependsOn": ["validate"] }
  ]
}
```

Definitions contain 1–64 steps, unique IDs, existing dependencies and no cycles. `maxParallel` is 1–16 (default 3). Context defaults to `partial`, requiring `contextText`; `full` freezes the current branch **once per workflow**, not once per step. Each step also receives bounded direct-upstream reports and their session paths. Reports are claims, not acceptance proof. Running tests usually requires `full` because `read-only` excludes bash.

Read-only steps may overlap; a full step runs alone **within its own workflow**. Other workflows, standalone subagents and external writers are not locked. Failure pauses new dispatch; active siblings finish normally. Questions use the existing child answer tool.

```json
{ "action": "inspect", "id": "auth-fix" }
{ "action": "pause", "id": "auth-fix" }
{ "action": "update", "id": "auth-fix", "steps": [{ "id": "extra-review", "task": "Check compatibility", "access": "read-only", "dependsOn": ["review"] }] }
{ "action": "retry", "id": "auth-fix", "stepId": "fix", "message": "Address the reported edge case", "access": "full" }
{ "action": "resume", "id": "auth-fix" }
{ "action": "cancel", "id": "auth-fix" }
```

These are independent control examples, not a sequence. Pause stops future dispatch, not active children. Updates require a paused workflow and only upsert unstarted steps. Retry requires an explicit instruction, a paused workflow, no active steps in it, confirmed cleanup, and no already-started descendants. It continues the same child session (or requeues if no child was created), and never automatically resumes scheduling. Completed workflows can be paused for a terminal-step follow-up; earlier steps with started descendants cannot be retried because that would invalidate their inputs. Use retained history for investigating those steps. No automatic blame attribution or rollback is provided.

Workflow JSON lives under the task directory's `workflows/` folder. Parent shutdown pauses scheduling before stopping children. Restart never auto-runs a workflow; inspect and explicitly resume. Unconfirmed orphan shutdown blocks scheduling and retry, requiring manual process/lock investigation. `/workflows [ID or name]` shows a snapshot; control changes use the tools.

### Child questions

`ask_question({ question })` blocks inside the child's tool execution through the RPC UI protocol. It is a sequential tool, so later child tools do not proceed past the question until the matching answer arrives. The parent gets the task and question IDs. Multiple different children can wait independently. Cancellation stops the waiting child.

## User interface

The main session has a compact live widget (up to five rows), showing task name/ID, state, elapsed time and current tool activity. It does not invent completion percentages.

Use **`/subagents`** (or `/subagents <task ID>`) to select a task, then:

- **Details**: scrollable snapshot of task/access, latest assistant text, questions and recent tool activity. This is a snapshot, not a streaming terminal; reopen to refresh. Editing the displayed copy changes nothing.
- **Message**: send supplementary instructions.
- **Answer question**: select a pending question and reply.
- **Cancel**: confirm and stop the task.
- **Continue**: start another run using the saved child session/loadout.

Live updates remain in the main widget. Completion/question messages can be expanded with Pi's normal tool/message expansion shortcut. Headless clients can use the control tool or the same RPC dialog protocol. No standalone child terminal is created.

## State, persistence and shutdown

States: `running`, `waiting`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`. `completed` means the child settled normally (including a successful terminating tool batch), **not that its changes passed acceptance**. The child is instructed to report completion/partial/block status, changes, validation and remaining issues; the parent decides acceptance.

Task records, frozen loadouts, prompt files and child JSONL sessions are stored under:

```text
<parent-session-directory>/rpc-subagents/<parent-session-id>/
```

Progress previews retain the latest 12,000 characters of assistant output, up to 100 log entries with approximately 1,000 characters each; tool responses are additionally bounded. Complete model/tool history is in the child session file. There is no automatic artifact deletion.

A completed/stopped child can be continued after a parent restart, with its original absolute cwd, model, tools, skills and extension paths. It uses its saved loadout, not the current parent inventory. Metadata is revalidated before continuation.

Shutdown/reload/session replacement stops managed children and suppresses late parent notifications. Partial file changes are not rolled back. Continuation requires confirmed shutdown and an exclusive lock. After an abrupt parent crash, records/locks are deliberately not auto-adopted: inspect orphan processes manually and start a fresh task if uncertain. Do not delete a lock and reopen a session while its old writer might still be alive.

There is no automatic concurrency cap or total execution deadline in v1. Assign a small number of independent tasks and cancel unwanted work. RPC command acknowledgements have a 15-second timeout; unknown acceptance causes failure/cleanup, never blind re-submission. Cancellation first waits a bounded time for outstanding prompt preflight receipts, including late receipts after caller timeout, then clears queued work and waits for an abort/idle acknowledgement before stdin shutdown, with bounded signal escalation. Pi 0.84.2 does not expose `clear_queue` over RPC, so the compatibility path aborts and then requires `get_state` to prove that the queue is empty; otherwise shutdown remains unconfirmed and retains the lock. New submissions are rejected while stopping; an idle abort alone cannot confirm cleanup while a prompt hook remains unresolved. If agent/tool cleanup or process exit cannot be confirmed, cancellation reports failure and retains the lock; root-process exit alone is not confirmation. An accepted prompt consumed by an input hook without starting or queueing work fails explicitly instead of remaining live. Arbitrary daemonized commands are outside this lifecycle guarantee. Linux/macOS process groups are supported; full Windows descendant cleanup is not yet validated.

## Development and isolated trial

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

Tests use deterministic fake RPC children, installed-Pi command-only preflight tests, and real parent/child RPC sessions with a local scripted provider. They exercise custom tool execution, builtin overrides, startup tools, skills, all context modes, model selection and questions without external provider calls or model quota. They do **not** establish that your configured provider will authenticate or complete a real task.

To try the extension without changing your global installation, from the project directory you want children to work in:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e /absolute/path/to/pi-interactive-subagents/pi-extension/subagents/index.ts
```

This intentionally disables the currently installed subagent extension for this trial process. Do not load both packages together: they register conflicting tool names. Start with a `none` investigation task, `access: "read-only"` and a model available to the child. Read-only filters tools but is not a filesystem sandbox. Trial tasks use real model quota. The extension requires a persistent parent session (not `--no-session`). Nothing in the source migration changes your current global settings or enables this package automatically.

## Source map

- `index.ts`: tools, session lifecycle, parent notifications
- `loadout.ts`: live runtime snapshots, canonical sources and inherited-loadout verification
- `context.ts`: none/partial/full snapshots and cooperation instructions
- `rpc.ts`: JSONL framing, request correlation and process cleanup
- `tasks.ts`: launch/control/question/completion lifecycle
- `store.ts`: durable records, bounded previews and session locks
- `child.ts`: blocking question tool and loadout preflight
- `ui.ts`: main widget, task menu and result rendering

Role profiles, `agents/`, the `agent` launch argument, `subagents_list` and bundled profile-only `safe_bash` are removed. Existing profile directories are ignored, not modified. Legacy v1 profile loadouts remain inspectable but cannot be continued; launch a new context-based task instead. The former tmux/Claude plugin registries are not migrated or automatically resumed.
